# GPT-O Exploration Project

Welcome to the GPT-O Exploration Project! This project serves as an experimental playground for exploring the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-O. By providing various types of input such as video, audio, image, and text, we aim to demonstrate the versatility and power of GPT-O in generating responses tailored to different contexts.

## Features

- **Chat Assistant**: Engage with a conversational chat assistant capable of responding to queries, cracking jokes, and solving math problems.
- **Video Processing**: Extract frames from a video, generate a summary, and analyze the content with GPT-O.
- **Audio Transcription**: Convert audio files to text transcripts and summarize the content using GPT-O.
- **Image Analysis**: Analyze images and incorporate them into the conversation with GPT-O.
- **Text Input**: Input various types of text data and observe GPT-O's responses.

## How to Use

1. **Installation**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

2. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Create a `.env` file and set up your OpenAI API key.

3. **Run the Code**:
   - Use the provided Python scripts to interact with GPT-O:
